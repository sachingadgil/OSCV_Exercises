# Notes for OpenCV-Python Tutorials
Personal folder to tryout oscv tutorials. Feel free to use or modify.

In many cases the code available did not work (most likely because it was written for python 2), hence I have to change it to make it work.
I did most of the exercises; some I have skipped, where I had less interest or setup, install related changes were not worth making them for one exercise
I have used OSCV 4 on Python 3.7 on windows 10

'exetasknum' variable is used to quickly try out different variation of the code or sub sections of the tutorial
